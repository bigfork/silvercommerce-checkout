Silverstripe Orders Module
==========================

Provides a simple order managemend interface, as well as an order object
that can be easily worked with from your own code.

In the future, it would be nice to add the ability to generate an XML
API to allow third party software to setup and manage orders (which
could be useful for integrating with inshop POI systems).

This module is designed to replace the current i-lateral Silverstripe
commerce module and will only provide the order admin and management
part of the module.
